# Getting an API Key

When you're ready to use the API in production using live data you can generate an API key in the menu for **Developer** settings.

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Keep your keys secure

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
{% endhint %}
