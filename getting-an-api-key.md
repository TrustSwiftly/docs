# Getting an API Key

When you're ready to use the API in production using live data you can generate an API key in the menu for **Developer** settings. You must click Create Token and provide a name to track it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Keep your keys secure

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to [https://{sub-domain}.trustswiftly.com/settings/developer](https://{sub-domain}.trustswiftly.com/settings/developer)
2. Click Create Token and name it according to your service.
3. Save the token securely as it will only be viewable one time.
