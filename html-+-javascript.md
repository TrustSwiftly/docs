# HTML + Javascript

## General

This document explains how to integrate the verification flow directly into your web application through our JavaScript component to **verify** the identity of your users. This stage might be at the **signup** page of your application, or at a later point to enrich the profiles of your users. An example page of the HTML integration can be found at [https://{sub-domain}.trustswiftly.com/account/test.html](https://{sub-domain}.trustswiftly.com/account/test.html)
