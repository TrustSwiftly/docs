# Introduction

### Quickstart

| Integration Options | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Embedded Form](html-+-javascript.md) | Follow the HTML + Javascript integration to create a button or form for users to complete their verifications. |
| [Rest API](getting-an-api-key.md) | Use the API to programmatically add users and modify required verifications.  |
| No Code Managed | Use the no code integration to share a simple link through email, chat, or SMS which will redirect the user to a hosted page. This method requires an admin to add the user to verify manually.  |
| No Code Self-Signup | Direct users to our signup page to register details themselves for onboarding and then allow them to complete the template verification request. This method requires no upfront work and can be used as customer identity management platform. |
