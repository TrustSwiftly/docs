# Share hosted link

The hosted URL is another simple no-code way to getting started with Trust Swiftly. The downside to it is the manual steps to create the link but it is useful for quick verifications and proof of concepts. This link can be found after creating a user for verification. It can be shared via email, sms, live chat, QR code or any other communication method you have with your users. Once your user clicks the link they can complete the verification on your custom hosted site.

1. After [adding a user](https://support.trustswiftly.com/how-to-create-a-new-user-to-verify.html) for verification you can find the URL option. On the Users page you can select Share Verify URL. This link is _sensitive_ and only meant for the user you plan to verify.

2. Copy the link and share it with your user. Next if needed you can modify the expiration time of the link. You can also send an email notification with the link to start a verification.
